# Building the TodoMVC App with Backbone.js

A learning exercise that deconstructs the creation of the [TodoMVC application](http://www.todomvc.com) with Backbone.js.

## Setup

Setup your local git environment so that Github will remember your username and password. This is so you won't have to enter them every time you interact with a remote repo on Github.

Login to Github online and fork the tutorial repo into your Github account: https://github.com/brandonminch/backbone-todomvc-tutorial

Create a local directory named "backbone-todomvc-tutorial" and clone the forked repo.

Switch your current branch to the branch named "exercise-01"

Create a new virtual host in MAMP named "local.todomvc.com" and point it at the root directory of the project.

View the README.md in the exercise-01 branch to begin the first exercise.
